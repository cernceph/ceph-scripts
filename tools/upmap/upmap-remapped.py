# DISCLAIMER 2: THIS TOOL USES A CEPH FEATURE MARKED "(developers only)"
# YOU SHOULD NOT RUN THIS UNLESS YOU KNOW EXACTLY HOW THOSE
# FUNCTIONALITIES WORK.
#
# upmap-remapped.py
#
# Usage (print only): ./upmap-remapped.py
# Usage (production): ./upmap-remapped.py | sh
#
# Optional to ignore PGs that are backfilling and not backfill+wait:
# Usage: ./upmap-remapped.py --ignore-backfilling
#
# This tool will use ceph's pg-upmap-items functionality to
# quickly modify all PGs which are currently remapped to become
# active+clean. I use it in combination with the ceph-mgr upmap
# balancer and the norebalance state for these use-cases:
#
# - Change crush rules or tunables.
# - Adding capacity (add new host, rack, ...).
#
# In general, the correct procedure for using this script is:
#
# 1. Backup your osdmaps, crush maps, ...
# 2. Set the norebalance flag.
# 3. Make your change (tunables, add osds, etc...)
# 4. Run this script a few times. (Remember to | sh)
# 5. Cluster should now be 100% active+clean.
# 6. Unset the norebalance flag.
# 7. The ceph-mgr balancer in upmap mode should now gradually
#    remove the upmap-items entries which were created by this
#    tool.
